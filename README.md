# SVGtoPlot
#### Make paths-only-SVG to a parametric function with Fourier Transformation.

Development will be very slow ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
<hr/>
 
### Plan to implement SVGtoPlot
  1. For given path, give range of parameter `t` from `k/n` to `(k+1)/n`.
  2. Make parametric equation for each path.
  3. Separate x-function and y-function.
  4. For each component, combine and execute FT with given accuracy and the number of terms of the result of FT.

### Building equations of commands
  - M
    - Since M is called only at the first time, we can assume that starting point of graph is set to given position.

  - L
    - Using fact that line segment from (a,b) to (c,d) can be written as h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(at+c(1-t),bt+d(1-t)) where 0<t<1, we can derive equation for L command.
  
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u(k+1-nt)+x(nt-k),v(k+1-nt)+y(nt-k))" title="equation not loaded" />
  - H
    - Using the equation of L, equation for H and V is easily derivable.
    
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u(k+1-nt)+x(nt-k),v)" title="equation not loaded" />
  - V
    - Same with H.
  
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u,v(k+1-nt)+y(nt-k))" title="equation not loaded" />
  - Z
    - It is exactly same with L, except destination point is set to the first point of path.
  
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u(k+1-nt)+u_{0}(nt-k),v(k+1-nt)+v_{0}(nt-k))" title="equation not loaded" />
  - Q
    - For quadratic bezier curve, points on the curve is written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;P=(1-t)^{2}U+2t(1-t)X_{1}+t^{2}X" title="equation not loaded" /> where U is the last point, X_1 is a given control point, and X is the destination point.
  
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u(k+1-nt)^{2}+2x_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)+x(nt-k)^{2},v(k+1-nt)^{2}+2y_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)+y(nt-k)^{2})" title="equation not loaded" />
  - T
    - Since continued, X_1 in Q is already set as U_1, the last control point.
  
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u(k+1-nt)^{2}+2u_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)+x(nt-k)^{2},v(k+1-nt)^{2}+2v_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)+y(nt-k)^{2})" title="equation not loaded" />
  - C
    - For cubic bezier curve, points on the curve is written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;P=(1-t)^{3}U+3t(1-t)^{2}X_{1}+3t^{2}(1-t)X_{2}+t^{3}X" title="equation not loaded" /> where U is the last point, X_1 and X_2 are given control points, and X is the destination point.
  
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u(k+1-nt)^{3}+3x_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)^{2}+3x_{2}(nt-k)^{2}(k+1-nt)+x(nt-k)^{3},v(k+1-nt)^{3}+3y_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)^{2}+3y_{2}(nt-k)^{2}(k+1-nt)+v(nt-k)^{3})" title="equation not loaded" />
  - S
    - Since continued, X_1 in C is already set as U_1, the last control point.
  
      <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;h(t)=(f(t),g(t))=(u(k+1-nt)^{3}+3u_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)^{2}+3x_{2}(nt-k)^{2}(k+1-nt)+x(nt-k)^{3},v(k+1-nt)^{3}+3v_{1}(nt-k)(k+1-nt)^{2}+3y_{2}(nt-k)^{2}(k+1-nt)+v(nt-k)^{3})" title="equation not loaded" />
  - A
  
    For given radii a and b, equation for ellipse can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\frac{(x-m)^2}{a^{2}}+\frac{(y-n)^2}{b^{2}}=1" title="equation not loaded" />, or in parametric form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\left\{\begin{matrix}x=m+a\cos{\theta}\\y=n+b\sin{\theta}\end{matrix}\right." title="equation not loaded" />.<br/>
    Using the last point U as (u, v), given destination point X as (s, t), and equation above, new system is built as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\left\{\begin{matrix}u=m+a\cos{\alpha}\\v=n+b\sin{\alpha}\\s=m+a\cos{\beta}\\t=n+b\sin{\beta}\end{matrix}\right." title="equation not loaded" />. The variables to solve are m, n, Î±, and Î². There will be two solutions for this system.<br/>
    By subtracting equation 1 and 3, following equation is derived. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;u-s=a(\cos{\alpha}-\cos{\beta})" title="equation not loaded" />. Samely with equation 2 and 4, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;v-t=b(\sin{\alpha}-\sin{\beta})" title="equation not loaded" />.<br/>
    Using trigonometric conversion equation, two equations above can be derived into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\left\{\begin{matrix}-\frac{u-s}{2a}=\sin\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\sin\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\\\frac{v-t}{2b}=\cos\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\sin\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\end{matrix}\right." title="equation not loaded" />.<br/>
    By dividing one of those equation by another one, a simple equation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\frac{u-s}{v-t}\frac{b}{a}=-\tan\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}" title="equation not loaded" /> is derived.
